1. In ordering task I've decided to implement ordering mechanism in TodoListDetailViewmodelFactory because it's a factory which produces specific Viewmodel for one View in which we would like to have such ordering, so for me it's the best place to implement this feature.
2. Decided to use resources for storing "user friendly" label for ResponsiblePartyId
3. In task 7 sord direction was not specified. Due to lack of time I've decided to use 'default' ASC way. In production solution I would add both ways to order by rank.
4. In task 8 added code to integrate with Gravatar API to get data of profile by e-mail. I've reused it not only for UserName but also for Image Url. I'm aware that solution is not perfect. Eg. I would like to get some values from configuration and not store it in static classes but have them registered in DI container, but as it's test aplication I can accept such decision.
